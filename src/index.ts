// Apple Music, for MyGo Music. The catalog, the listener's library and
// playlists, charts, recommendations, stations and word-timed lyrics come from
// the same API the web player at music.apple.com uses.
//
// Songs play whole, as the 256 kbps AAC the web player plays. Apple encrypts
// it with Widevine: the plugin asks Apple's license server for the key as the
// web player would, with a Widevine CDM written here in plain TypeScript, and
// amhelper, the program shipped with the plugin, takes the encryption off,
// copying the audio as it is into an .m4a the app plays itself (ffmpeg does,
// where the plugin's zip has no amhelper). Nothing is re-encoded. With the
// listener's wrapper, songs play lossless as ALAC instead (lossless.ts).
//
// These exports are the plugin: what MyGo Music calls. While the app waits on
// one, what's fetched of the library ahead waits too (background.ts).
